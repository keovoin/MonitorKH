## TAG: depth
**MISS:** Initial enhancement plan was too broad
**FIX:** Narrowed to 10 specific, achievable initiatives

## TAG: consensus
**MISS:** Started coding before finalizing requirements
**FIX:** Created detailed initiative tracker before implementation

## TAG: speed
**MISS:** Some Codex sessions timed out
**FIX:** Wrote services directly when Codex was slow

## TAG: confidence
**MISS:** Unclear if all features would work together
**FIX:** Focused on core infrastructure (meta tags, deep links) first

### Completed
- 6/10 initiatives fully complete
- 3/10 initiatives ready for final action (launch posts)
- 1/10 pending final push

### What Worked
- Batch processing similar initiatives (feeds together, templates together)
- Using Codex for complex services (geo-convergence, temporal baseline)
- Creating tracker document to maintain focus

### What Could Improve
- Should have staged Reddit posts instead of all at once
- Could have tested story sharing before polishing copy
