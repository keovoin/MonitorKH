What World Monitor tracks:

📰 80+ curated news sources (government, defense, think tanks)
✈️ Real-time military flights (ADS-B)
⚓ Naval vessel tracking (AIS)
📊 Country Instability Index (0-100)
🎯 Polymarket prediction correlations
🌍 Infrastructure: cables, pipelines, nuclear

All in one unified dashboard.
```

**Tweet 3 (Intelligence):**
```
The killer feature: Convergence Detection

When 3+ independent signals (protests + military + news) point to the same region, you get an alert.

This is how real intelligence works — correlation across sources, not just single headlines.

**Tweet 4 (Free/Open):**
```
Commercial OSINT tools cost $10K+/year.

World Monitor is free because information should be accessible.

Built with:
• TypeScript + Vite
• deck.gl for maps
• Groq Llama 3.1 for AI
• Redis caching

### LinkedIn Post

```
I'm excited to announce World Monitor 2.0 — an open-source geopolitical intelligence platform I've been building for the past year.

**The Problem**
Commercial intelligence tools cost $10K+/year, putting serious analysis out of reach for most researchers, journalists, and concerned citizens.

**What It Does**
- Aggregates 80+ global news feeds, military tracking, and infrastructure data
- Calculates real-time Country Instability Index for 190+ countries
- Detects "convergence" when multiple signals point to the same region
- Uses Polymarket prediction markets as leading indicators

**What's New Today**
- 📊 Enhanced Country Instability Index with 7-day trends
- 🚨 Geographic convergence alerts
- ⏰ Temporal anomaly detection
- 📱 Shareable intelligence stories for WhatsApp, Twitter, LinkedIn

**The Mission**
Make world-class geopolitical intelligence accessible to everyone. Not just those with enterprise budgets.

Hey r/cybersecurity,

I've been building an open-source intelligence platform for the past year. Today's 2.0 launch adds some significant features.

**What it does:**
- Aggregates 80+ RSS feeds (defense, energy, tech, government)
- Tracks military flights, naval vessels, infrastructure
- Shows real-time instability scores for 190+ countries
- Detects "convergence" when multiple signals point to the same region

**What's new in 2.0:**
- Country Instability Index 2.0 with 7-day trends
- Temporal anomaly detection (spot unusual activity)
- Shareable "Stories" for intelligence snapshots

**Why I built it:**
Commercial OSINT tools cost $10K+/year. I wanted something free and open that anyone could use.

Title: Built an open-source geopolitical intelligence platform (free, no API keys)

Body:
After years working in intelligence-adjacent roles, I got tired of:
- Paying $15K/year for commercial OSINT tools
- Manually checking 50+ sources every morning
- Missing things because data wasn't correlated

So I built World Monitor:

**Features:**
- 80+ curated news feeds (government, defense, think tanks)
- Military tracking (ADS-B flights, AIS vessels)
- Country Instability Index with component breakdown
- Convergence detection (protests + military + news in same region)
- Temporal anomaly detection
- Shareable intelligence "stories"

**Data Sources:**
- ACLED/GDELT (protests, conflicts)
- OpenSky Network (military flights)
- MarineTraffic (vessels)
- Polymarket (prediction markets)
- 80+ RSS feeds

Free. Open source. No API keys required.
